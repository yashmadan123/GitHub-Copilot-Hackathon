## Task 5: Code Generation with Copilot and Copilot Chat

In this task, you'll create a Python/JS code to build a calculator and use OpenWeatherMap API keys to get weather data from weather APIs.

1. Open the GitHub Copilot chat window and ask GitHub Copilot to create a Python/JS code to build a calculator using the below prompt.

   ```
   Create a Python/JS based code to build a calculator 
   ```

   ![](../../media/copilotchat.png)

   ![](../../media/copilot-calculatorupd.png)

   >**Note:** The output may vary in your case. It won't be exactly the same, but it will be similar to the image provided.

1. Notice how GitHub Copilot creates code to build a calculator in both Python and JavaScript. Save the files to run tests.

   - Python code to build a calculator:
     ```
     def add(x, y):
     return x + y

     def subtract(x, y):
     return x - y

     def multiply(x, y):
     return x * y

     def divide(x, y):
     if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
     else:
        return x / y

     print("Select operation:")
     print("1.Add")
     print("2.Subtract")
     print("3.Multiply")
     print("4.Divide")

     while True:
        choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")

        if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
          num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
          num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

     if choice == '1':
            print(num1, "+", num2, "=", add(num1, num2))

     elif choice == '2':
            print(num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract(num1, num2))

     elif choice == '3':
            print(num1, "*", num2, "=", multiply(num1, num2))

     elif choice == '4':
            print(num1, "/", num2, "=", divide(num1, num2))
     break

     else:

     print("Invalid Input")

     ```

   - JS code to build a calculator

     ```
      // Function to add two numbers
      function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }

      // Function to subtract two numbers
      function subtract(a, b) {
        return a - b;
      }

      // Function to multiply two numbers
      function multiply(a, b) {
        return a * b;
      }

      // Function to divide two numbers
      function divide(a, b) {
        if (b === 0) {
          return "Error: Division by zero";
        }
        return a / b;
      }

      // Declare and assign values to num1 and num2
      var num1 = 5;
      var num2 = 3;

      console.log("Addition:", add(num1, num2));
      console.log("Subtraction:", subtract(num1, num2));
      console.log("Multiplication:", multiply(num1, num2));
      console.log("Division:", divide(num1, num2));
     ```
      > **Note:** Declare the two variables/numbers before running tests through JS.

      >**Note:** The output may vary in your case. It won't be exactly the same, but it will be similar to the code provided.

1. Run tests for the files by experimenting with different operations to verify the working of the calculator.

1. To access weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, sign in to your account on their website: [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).

   ![](../../media/signinapi.png)

1. Create a new one to get the weather data using code by clicking on **Create an Account**.

   ![](../../media/createaaccount.png)

1. To create a new OpenWeather account, the user fills in their username **(1)**, email address **(2)**, password **(3 and 4)**, agrees to the terms by checking the required boxes **(5 and 6)**, completes the CAPTCHA **(7)**, and finally clicks the **Create Account** button **(8)**.

   ![](../../media/weather-api-keys1.png)

1. Then sign in using the same username and credentials.

   >**Note:** Please use OLD username and password.

1. Open the GitHub Copilot chat window and ask GitHub Copilot to create a Python/JS-based app to get weather data from weather APIs.

   ```
   Create a Python/JS based app to get weather data from weather APIs
   ```

   ![](../../media/copilot-weather-api.png)

1. Notice how GitHub Copilot creates code to get weather data from weather APIs in both Python and JavaScript.

   - Python:

     ```
     import requests

     def get_weather(city):
       API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR WEATHER API KEY HERE'
       BASE_URL = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}"
       response = requests.get(BASE_URL)
       data = response.json()
       main = data['main']
       print(f"Temperature: {main['temp']}")
       print(f"Humidity: {main['humidity']}")
       print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}")

     city = input("Enter the city: ")
     get_weather(city)
     ```

   - JS:

     ```
     async function getWeather(city) {
        const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR WEATHER API KEY HERE';
        const BASE_URL = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}`;
        const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}`);
        console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}`);
        console.log(`Weather: ${data.weather[0].description}`);
     }

     const city = 'Mumbai';  // Replace with the city you want to get the weather for
     getWeather(city);
     ```

   > **Note:** Enter the name of the city before running tests through JS.

1. Run tests for the files by entering different cities to verify that the weather data is being fetched from the weather APIs.

1. Push the files to your forked **CloudLabsAI-Azure/Code-Generation-Refactoring** GitHub repository.

## Task 6: Code Refactoring & Debugging

In this task, you'll be refactoring and debugging the poorly written Python code using GitHub Copilot and testing out a few scenarios.

1. Open the **sum_elements.py** file by double-clicking on it.

1. Select the entire code, right-click, and click **Refactor** and select *Modify using Copilot*, and ask the Copilot to refactor the selected code.

1. You'll notice that GitHub Copilot has refactored and fixed the code.

   ```
   #A poorly written example of a program in Python. It prompts the user for the number of elements to sum, takes those integers as input, and handles some basic error cases

   MAX = 100

   def calculate_sum(arr):
      return sum(arr)

   def main():
      try:
         n = int(input("Enter the number of elements (1-100): "))
         if not 1 <= n <= MAX:
            print("Invalid input. Please provide a digit ranging from 1 to 100.")
            exit(1)

         arr = []

         print(f"Enter {n} integers:")
         for _ in range(n):
            try:
               arr.append(int(input()))
            except ValueError:
               print("Invalid input. Please enter valid integers.")
               exit(1)

         total = calculate_sum(arr)

         print("Sum of the numbers:", total)

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         print("\nProgram terminated by user.")
         exit(1)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
   ```

1. Accept the changes and save the file. Run a few test cases to verify that the code refactored by GitHub Copilot is accurate.

1. Open the **card_draw.py** file by double-clicking on it.

   ```
   # Intentionally flawed Python program

   # importing modules
   import itertools
   import random

   # make a deck of cards
   deck = list(itertools.product(range(1, 14), ['Spade', 'Heart', 'Diamond', 'Club']))

   # shuffle the cards
   random.shuffle(deck)

   # draw five cards
   print("You got:")
   for i in range(5):
      print(deck[i][0], "of", deck[i][1])
   ```

1. Accept the changes and save the file. Run a few test cases to verify that the code debugged by GitHub Copilot is working as expected.

## Task 7: Explore GitHub Copilot Features
